Details of the Air Quality Forecast Challenge 2021, that would be used for evaluation in the lecture course Data “Science in Techno-Socio-Economic Systems”, course number 851-0585-38L. All submissions focus on air quality data logging, outlier detection and PM2.5 forecast.

### Project Goal 
The goal of the Air Quality Forecast challenge is to use a Raspberry Pi Zero and environment monitoring sensors to monitor the ambient environment and predict the air quality level in Zurich. To measure the air quality level, we need to know the mass of PM2.5 in a volume of air given by micrograms per cubic meters.
